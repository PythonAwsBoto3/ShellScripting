Q.What is a Shell Script ?
Ans:
#Shell program is also called as Shell Script. 
#All scripting languages are programming languages but all programming languages are not scripting languages.

Shell script is defined as is text file that contains series/sequence of commands for Unix like systems.
So, simply, in shell script each line is a one Unix command.

Let me do simple commands:
pwd

ls -lrt 

instead of running these two commands, you can create a simple file which consist of these two commands.

like:
  #!/bin/bash
  pwd
  ls
  
Now observe the output. which is same as, when we ran commands one by one command right.

Now, you shold also know what is a shell ?

Shell is basically is an interpreter.
Shell is an interface between user and Unix kernal.
So, our shell scripting language comes under interpreted language.
That means you can run one by one line of your shell script even from command line also.


In Unix like systems you are having different types of Shells:
  ex:
    Bash Shell
    Sh Shell
    C Shell
    K  Sell
    Z Shell
    Fish Shell
    
   The way how to write shell scripting in each shell follows same concept but syntaxes are different.
   In this Video Series i will go with Bash Shell. That is Bash Shell Scripting.
